# Form Builder App

This project is a visual form builder where users can create, edit, reorder, and delete form elements dynamically. The form is rendered using sample JSON data, and all CRUD operations are powered by `json-server`. The project also supports drag-and-drop reordering and has an intuitive user interface for easy customization of forms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CRUD Functionality with JSON Server

This project uses `json-server` to handle all CRUD operations:

- **Create**: Add new form elements to the server.
- **Read**: Fetch the form data from the server to render the form.
- **Update**: Modify existing form elements, reorder them, or edit their properties.
- **Delete**: Remove form elements from the server.
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop any form element vertically and click save to get the new ordered Ui in console.

To start the server, follow these steps:

1. Install `json-server` globally: `npm install -g json-server`
2. Start the server: `json-server --watch db.json`
3. The app will connect to `http://localhost:8080` for CRUD operations.
